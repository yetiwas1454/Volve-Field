Volve Field Data Analysis

Overview
This repository contains the work done on the Volve field dataset, focusing on the preparation, analysis, and visualization of data.

Key Activities for Volve Field

Dataset Preparation and Collection
- Initiated the preparation and collection of the dataset for Material Balance through MBAL.
- Gathered and compiled all available datasets and documented their usage. Started conducting the material balance analysis for the Volve oil field.
- Worked on preparing the pressure data for the Volve field.
- Prepared the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) format dataset for the Volve field.

Data Analysis and Visualization
- Created a Python plot visualizing data for the Volve field.
- Completed dataset plotting with Python and included the Volve field in a presentation covering open-source datasets from various oil fields.
- Created a Pivot table for the Volve field and started working on an interactive dashboard.
- Finished the dashboard for the Volve field.
- Completed dashboards for five fields, including Volve, and compiled the reservoir parameters and well data in Excel format.
- Compiled data for the Volve field in Excel and corrected dashboards.

Further Analysis and Data Acquisition
- Studied the Volve field and aimed to obtain log data and perforation data for remaining wells.
- Obtained well log data for two exploratory wells and found new parameters for the Volve field.

Tools and Techniques
- Python: Used for plotting and data visualization.
- Excel: Compiled reservoir parameters and well data.
- Interactive Dashboards: Created for a comprehensive view of the Volve field data.
- Prophet Model: Applied for time series analysis and forecasting.
- Cost Estimation Calculations: Conducted to evaluate the economic aspects of the Volve field operations. (The actual work cannot be shared due to licensing restrictions)
